# Hotel-booking-dashboard
An excel dashboard analyzing hotel booking cancellations different factors.
This project presents a detailed excel dashboard that explores patterns and insights from hotel booking data, with a specific focus on booking cancellations. The visualization provides a comprehensive analysis of how and why cancellations occur, segmented by various attributes such as guest type, hotel type, room status, arrival month, and country.

## üöÄ Objectives
The dashboard was designed to answer the following key business questions:

Which guest types are most likely to cancel bookings?

How do cancellation rates vary between Resort and City hotels?

Which months experience the highest cancellation rates?

What is the relationship between room preference (desired/undesired) and cancellations?

Which countries have the highest number of cancellations?

What is the overall cancellation rate compared to total bookings?

## üìå Key Insights
Couples have the highest number of total bookings and also the highest cancellations.

City hotels experience significantly more bookings and cancellations compared to Resort hotels.

July and August see peak booking volumes with relatively high cancellation numbers.

Guests who do not get their desired room status are more likely to cancel.

The dashboard supports year-wise filtering (2015, 2016, 2017) and country-specific insights.
